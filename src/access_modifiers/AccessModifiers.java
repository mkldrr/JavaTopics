//    Access Modifiers
//    Java  uses access modifier concept to give proper access to determine the scope of the variables, methods and classes.
//
//    Project hierarchy
//   â€” project (main project)
//         â€” src (folder that stores code) src =  source
//               â€” packages ðŸ“¦ (src can have multiple packages)
//            â€” Java Class
//
//    Q can we use a project in different project
//â€” yes.  By making project as â€˜.jarâ€™ format.
//
//    Every single variable, every single method, class, must have access modifiers EXEPT for local variables
//
//    Java has 4 access modifiers
//
//    All four (4) access modifiers can be used for variables and methods.
//     Java class can only be public or default
//    Can a constructor be private ? : Yes, mean you can only in that class.
//    If constructor is default, that can be called only in the same packages.
//    What is the difference between importing and accessibility ; no connection, importing is about using class,
//    access modifier is giving scope for the members of the class or class itself.
//
//    Default â€“ No keyword required: only within the same package whenever we donâ€™t mention./   scope: only within the package
//    Private: onlyÂ within the classÂ in which they are declared.
//    Protected   : accessible within same package or sub classes in different package.
//    Public : public areÂ accessible from every whereÂ in the program, within the project.Â
