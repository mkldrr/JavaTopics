   // //    What is a collection?
//            —it is a one unit, that can store many other units.
//            —SO, far we used Arrays and ArrayList .add   list.add
//      —each element is read with using the index.
//    The collection will always be in the order you create it. The elements are accessed by indexes.
//
//    Why do we have different collection types?
//            —there is always multiple approaches.
//—  there is different implementation of the list interface being used in the collection framework.
//
//            —there is different implementations which allows for different algorithms of data manipulations.
//
//—ex: add method from list.
//            — in arrayLis, the add method puts the element at the end of collection
//
//—performance :
//            —The classes implement the List interface in different ways to improve the performance of operations such as adding, removing, getting, searching, etc…
//            —————————————————————————————————————————
//
//
//    List vs Set  (interfaces)
//—List: ordered and allows duplicates. java.util.ArrayList,LinkedList,Vector,Stack
//—java.util.Set: it is unordered, there is no indexes. It does not allow duplicates.
//
//—the only way to store elements in order as Set, it is to convert to ArrayList constructor.
