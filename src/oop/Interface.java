    //    They act like a class, and they can have variables.
//    Is one of the way to do abstraction.
//            Additional abstract methods that don't belong to all classes.
//
//
//    Interface can only have abstract methods. And only public.
//    All methods in the interface are public abstract by default.  But by making methods static, it becomes non-abstract class.
//            *3 Types of interface :
//            — public abstract method > has no body
//  —         static methods : can be called by using name > has a body
//  —         default methods: has a body, this is not access modifier.
//
//             Variables in Interface:
//            —We can have them but they need to be final and static.
//            —all variables are public static final. They have to be initialized.
//—           because final variables, it is better to make capital.
//           Methods can be private after java 9
//
//            *Using Interface  with other classes
//
//    Keyword: implements should be used
