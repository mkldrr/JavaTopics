//    Custom Class Members
//
//    Instance Variable
//— info that long to each object which is created from the specific info
//2) Methods
//— behaviors that belong to each object
//3) - Constructors
//— special kind of method that creates an object
//
//    STATIC MEMBERS:
//
//    Variables and methods can be static.
//
//            —Static members belong to the Class. Not the object
//    —- this means that you don’t need to create object to use those members.
//— The static members belong to the class so they are shared with all object.
//    Ex. of Static method from Java
//     —- Don’t need this : Arrays arr = new Arrays ( );
//
//Arrays.sort( )
//        Arrays.toString ( )
//
//
//
//    Example of non static methods from Java
//    nextInt ( ) from Scanner
//    trim ( ) from String class
//    nextInt ( ) from Random class
